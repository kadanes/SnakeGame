This game works by printing frame content line by line and periodically updating it. To change the fps, change the value of the global variable lag. Higher value means slower snake speed. A highscore.txt file will keep track of your score.
Use W A S D to control the snake.

## This code is a snapshot in time. It was written in my sophomore year of engineering before I knew version control.
